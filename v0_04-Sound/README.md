# Sound
In this version, there are a few objectives for the project:
- [ ] Make sense of the core engine
- [ ] Sketch a preliminary documentation
- [ ] Implement sound on the core engine

This README by itself will be used as such sketch in order to facilitate future understanding of the inner workings of the engine. Thus:

## Core engine Documentation
The engine is structured mainly with an DOP desing in mind.
Here are the purpose and usage of some of the classes:

### Core Engine:
#### Camera
#### VAO´s, VBO´s and IBO´s:
#### Renderer
#### Shader
#### Texture

### Modules:
#### Bitmap Font
#### Freetype Font

## Sound Implementation Notes
- v0.04.00: README refactoring
- v0.04.01: Inclusion of Bitmap and Freetype as modules of the core engine
