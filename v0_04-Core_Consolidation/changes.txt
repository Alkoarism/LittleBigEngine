Changes made throught iterations of test samples of the Engine while
configuring Linux machine compilation (via WSL) makefiles:

change \ to / on every .cpp and .h file.

the makefile is configured to include the 'include_linux' and 'dep_linux'
folders in order to keep it clean from cross IDE mismatch. All linux related
changes are being made into these (including the system specific compilation of
the GLFW libraries).


On the vertex_buffer_layout.h file, there must be a change to the 
VertexBufferLayout class; the specialization of the template Push function
must be declared as inline functions outside of the class. Here are two examples:

	template<>
	inline void VertexBufferLayout::Push<float>(const int count) {
		m_Elements.push_back(VertexAttribute(GL_FLOAT, count, GL_FALSE));
		m_Stride += count * VertexAttribute::GetSizeOfType(GL_FLOAT);
	}

	template<>
	inline void VertexBufferLayout::Push<int>(const int count) {
		m_Elements.push_back(VertexAttribute(GL_INT, count, GL_FALSE));
		m_Stride += count * VertexAttribute::GetSizeOfType(GL_INT);	
(OBS: This might be a good change for both versions of the file.)
