Things to be noted:
	Understand how to retrieve a normal vector from a model´s vertices
	Change the camera to a true first person with heigh adjustment

	Form Learn OpenGL:
		"Inversing matrices is a costly operation for shaders, so wherever possible
	try to avoid doing inverse operations since they have to be done on each vertex
	of your scene. For learning purposes this is fine, but for an efficient
	application you'll likely want to calculate the normal matrix on the CPU and send
	it to the shaders via a uniform before drawing (just like the model matrix)."

Things to read about:
	An article about a special matrix used to normalize non-uniform matrix
